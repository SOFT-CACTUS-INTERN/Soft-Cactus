1-Set the custom colors themes in the global css file index.css
2-made the default colors in this order and manually added classes like tailwind font-bebas and font-montserrat  since the tailwind.config.js file didn't seem to work, probably it is deprecated or something
3-font-family: "Montserrat","Bebas Neue",Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got rid of tailwind, will use css modules instead for full control
so ' 1- ' is off
framer motion for animating
